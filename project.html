      <h3>Problem</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Currently, there's not a cloud storage app that does it all. It can become frustrating for users, like myself, to switch between apps that do different things - Dropbox only allows you to store and share files, Pinterest only lets you save and share files. People are always looking for the next best storage space. A new competitor has huge shoes to fill in order to be competitive in the current marketplace. They need to kind of be all things for all people, or offer something niche to a market that really needs something like it.</p>

      <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <hr>

        <img src="" alt="Google Drive logo"></img>
        <p>Cloud Storage has been something that has been on the market for about a decade. There are many services, some niche and some further reaching. I decided to focus on the companies that I, along with my colleagues, tend to use the most. The three companies offer different things to the market, but none of them are the one-stop shops that users are asking for. Google Drive allows you to store, create, and share content. Dropbox is strictly a store and share app. Pinterest is a visual sharing app.</p>
        <br>
        <p>While there are many cloud storage apps on the market, there’s still room for a new app, like Wisp, to enter the market and break some barriers.</p>

        <p>Of participants say their biggest frustration with the current selection of apps is how much storage you get for free vs. how much you get when you pay.</p>

      <h3>User Personas</h3>
        <hr>
          <p>After conducting the user surveys along with three user interviews, I create two user personas to embody the typical users for the app. I did this by analyzing the patterns found in my research.</p>

      <h3>Branding</h3>
        <hr>
          <p>Creating a brand for this cloud app was a huge part of the process. While everything else is important, the brand helps set the tone for the users. It can make or break a brand.
          Security & trustworthiness is the most important aspect of a cloud storage app. You want someone to see the logo, marks, and colors and feel as if they can trust you to store their information. I took this idea and the fact that this app would be used by mostly young professionals to create a brand. I wanted it to seem secure, but I wanted it to seem current as well. Something light-hearted & airy, yet relatable & secure to help break-up the seriousness of it all. When you go back to the competitive analysis, the brands for those aren’t the most exciting. I wanted the whole brand to feel updated.
          I took the words light-hearted, familiar, energetic, and secure and formed the brand.</p>

    <img src="" alt="Image from my moodboard"></img>
    <img src="" alt="Image of my initial logo sketches"></img>
    <section id="">
      <p>The logo evolved once I created the moodboard, the brand style guide, and the color palette. It went from being a bit stark and unfinished looking to being one cohesive brand.</p>
        <br>
          <p>The logo is kept simple. It will always appear as one color, whether that is the full-color version or the black or white version. I believe this is the way to go because it creates a bit of a trademark color and feel to the brand that doesn’t necessarily already exist. Think about the colors that your competitors use - Pinterest = red, Dropbox = blue, etc. The light blue hue that I chose is different from the typical primary colors that are used currently, however it isn’t such a far cry that a user won’t feel like they’re unable to trust it. Blue is a color that typically evokes trust and loyalty - both things that we want the user to feel.</p>

    <img src="" alt="WISP logo"></img>
    <img src="" alt="Image showing my color palette"></img>
    <section id="">
      <p>I chose the supporting colors to keep up with the light-hearted feel that we’re trying to achieve - a deeper purple, a dusty blue, a bright turquoise, and black for contrast. Together these colors work as a team to help achieve a pleasant, secure, light-hearted, and casual feeling that we hope will draw the users in.</p>

      <p>The header font is Comfortaa. I felt this complemented the icon and is nice enough to tie the branding throughout the website and through possible future print pieces as well. The body copy will be in Roboto. Roboto is relatable, it’s a font that fits nicely with most other fonts, and it’s easy to read in large blocks of text.</p>

      <h3>Iterations</h3>
        <hr>
          <p>Like any project that you would encounter in the real-world, user feedback was very important. I ended up having several iterations of the design. They completely changed from initial pencil wireframes through the whole process. Here, I will layout the different versions that I went through.</p>
      </section>
    <section id="">
      <p>Version 2.0 was the version that I used for High-Fi User Testing. I was trying to break away from the typical hero image that you see on most websites these days. I thought it might work, but after feedback from several people, I realized that it just wasn’t working. Something else that I ended up changing drastically was the Account Dashboard page. This iteration doesn’t really do the job that we set out to do - make accessing, sharing, and viewing files easy. So, I worked on a new version.</p>
    </section>
    <img src="" alt="Screens showing version 2.0"></img>
    <section id="">
      <p>Version 3.0 came after a critique from an industry vet looked at my work. When you get constructive criticism it can do one of two things - break you or make you. I took what felt like harsh feedback and started working on the new version immediately. The landing page is the one that has ended up making it all the way to the end of this with me. The account dashboard has changed a few times, though. As you can see, it’s completely different from the first iteration. There are now options for viewing the files in a grid or list, it’s a bit cleaner than the original and isn’t as blocky, and most importantly, it begins to work for the user rather than make the user work for it.</p>
    </section>
    <img src="" alt="Screens showing version 3.0"></img>
    <section id="">
      <p>As I stated previously, my landing page stayed final, however I changed my account dashboard up a bit more after receiving more feedback.  Main features that changed were cleaning up the sidebar menu and bringing it to be full-length with the page, extending the colored line right under the menu to go up to the top of the page, and cleaning up the grid to be a bit more uniform.</p>
    </section>
    <img src="" alt="Screens showing version 3.1"></img>
    <section id="">
      <p>This is my final iteration of the design. I changed the account dashboard on both the mobile and desktop versions. I changed the way things were spaced, and made it a bit more uniform and I think more user friendly. I also changed some of the icons to be more consistent.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <hr>
          <p>This was my very first UX project from start to finish. It was certainly a challenge and the learning curve was steep - however the experience was incredibly valuable. I currently work on a team and am not responsible for copy, research, or branding. It was really enlightening to take the whole project from the very beginning with discovery all the way to the end with the whole finished design.</p>
